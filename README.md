Install Project Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project's root directory and populate it with your credentials.

.env example:

SECRET_KEY='your-super-secret-key-goes-here'
DB_NAME='healthcare_db'
DB_USER='your_postgres_username'
DB_PASSWORD='your_postgres_password'
DB_HOST='localhost'

Set Up the PostgreSQL Database
You must create the database and user role in PostgreSQL before running the application.

-- Connect to psql as a superuser
CREATE ROLE your_postgres_username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_postgres_password';
CREATE DATABASE healthcare_db OWNER your_postgres_username;

Apply Database Migrations
This will create the necessary tables in your database.

python manage.py makemigrations api
python manage.py migrate

Launch the Server!
